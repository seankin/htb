File Inclusion/Directory Traversal : Challenge solution of Academy.

I have register with free panny and try to get medal in academy because I have solved all active machine in hack the box. So lets begin to solve LFI challenge.

As you can see url: is looking LFI : http://x.x.x.x:30061/index.php?page=about

(i) In first step we will intercept the request using burp

(ii) Now after some hits its clear we can bypass this type LFI using php wrapper they don’t need extension and safely bypassed so we tried

php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=about this wrapper can bypass

(iii) we again intercept request of index page : now we have base64 code

(iv) Now we can decode it easily with different mode: i have choose my favorite : terminal

echo <base64code> |base64 -d

reading view source we found a commented line in php. Here is admin page(ilf_admin/index.php). so visit it find new LFI linke

(v)by visiting :http://x.x.x.x:30061/ilf_admin/index.php?log=http.log we can see here is LFI so lets exploit it.

again intercept request in burp

(vi) we are exploit log file so now our aim it write <?php system($_GET[‘cmd’]); ?> and execute our cmd.

we have multiple option to exploit cmd.

(a) reverse shell

(b)direct read dir and file

We can see directory listing . so now you can execute your command.

I have lost 3 hours to get flag its lot off time to get flag so my aim to save my reader time.
