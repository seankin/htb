Source Code Disclosure via PHP Wrappers

- In this scenario, our only option is to include PHP files and find sensitive information or vulnerabilities in the source code. 
- Such files can be found by performing a brute force against the webserver for files with a .php extension, using tools such as gobuster, dirbuster, or dirsearch. 
- Direct inclusion of these PHP files won't return anything, as the server will execute it as code. For example, consider a file named config.php, which is present on the server.
